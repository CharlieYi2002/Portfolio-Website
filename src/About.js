            I was born and raised in Cupertino, CA and spent my entire life there until college where I moved to Los Angeles, CA to attend USC. My experience
            in The Bay shaped much of my personality and passions, including my academic interests as well as personal hobbies.

            In my free time, I spend a lot of his time being active. I've been playing volleyball since I was 12 years old and have 
            played on USC Men's Club Volleyball team for my entire duration at USC. In high school, I coached volleyball at a local clinic for all 4 years
            and then coached the Women's JV and Men's Varsity team at Saratoga HS during my freshman year of college. Beyond volleyball, I also 
            enjoy working out, hiking, and skiing/snowboarding. Most recently, I've gotten into pickle ball!

          <h2>Academic Background</h2>

          <p>
            I first started coding in 8th grade where I went to an after school class to learn Java. It was there that I developed my initial passion for computer science.
            My freshman year of high school, I continued taking that class but took Java at my highschool on top of itâ€”eventually taking AP Computer Science my sophomore year
            of highschool.
          </p>

          <p>
          At USC, I pursued a double major in Data Science & Economics. As part of my Data Science electives, I was able to take various courses about Web Development such as Intro
          to Full-Stack, Advanced Front-end Web Development, and Design for UI/UX. These classes helped me discover my passion for full-stack engineering and helped me develop my own
          skills in front-end. I am passionate for website development specifically because of the design and creative aspect in it. I love getting to work on a project, either designed
          by myself or by an actual designer, and getting to see the progression from start to finish.

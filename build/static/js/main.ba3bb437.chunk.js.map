I'm currently a senior at University of Southern California pursuing\n            a double major in Data Science and Economics. Throughout my coursework for my Data Science degree, I took various \n            front-end development courses such as Full-Stack Web Development, Advanced Front-end Web Development, Design for UI/UX,\n            and Design for Data Visualization. These courses paired with the various database courses fostered a passion for full-stack\n            web development. \n            \n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Outside of academics I spend a lot of his time being active. I've been playing volleyball since I was 12 years old and have \n            played on USC Men's Club Volleyball team for my entire duration at USC. Beyond volleyball, I also enjoys working out, hiking, \n            and skiing/snowboarding.\n          </p>\n\n          <img src={Volleyball} alt=\"volleyball\" className = 'float-left'/>\n        </div>\n        \n        \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n  ","import React, {useEffect } from \"react\";\nimport \"./styles.css\";\n\nexport default function Projects() {\n    useEffect(() => {\n        document.title = \"Projects\";\n      }, []);\n    return (\n      <div className = 'text'>\n\n        <h2>BoardGame Buddies</h2>\n\n        <p>\n            BoardGame Buddies was my final project in my Advanced Front-End Web Development course. The course itself was taught \n            exclusively in Reactjs. Our project guideline was very broad and the professor wanted us to create something that was \n            interesting to us, so I created a boardgame application since my roommates are avid boardgame players.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            The home page references a slideshow created using 'react-slideshow-image'.

At the bottom of the\n            page, the user can also recommend games using the recommendation form. The information submitted is stored locally using node.js.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            The page 'Log Game' is a feature that allows the user to log their games and see statistics.

The premise of the\n        project was to design a web application that incorporated two different NoSQL databases. We decided to create a project to help other Data Science and Economics\n        majors with their course web registration. Using Neo4j (a graph database), Liu created a graph of the courseplan someone of our major would take. Connecting each\n        node were relationships called \"prerequisite\". Once the relationship is created, the user has the ability to choose classes based on the prerequisites they have taken.\n        The prerequisite relationships can be added by the user when they enter the course ID for classes they have taken before.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Porter created a Dynamo Database which contained more specific information about the courses offered such as Professor name, class days/times, and class location.\n        After the user adds prerequisites to the Neo4j Database, we map the course ID to the corresponding row in the DynamoDB and the content in that database is shown for the user\n        to choose classes and that information is shown in the user coursebin.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        I was in charge of developing the front-end which I wrote primarily in Reactjs. \n      </p>\n        \n        \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n  ","import React from \"react\";\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport \"./styles.css\";\nimport NAV from \"./NAV\";\nimport Home from \"./Home.js\"\nimport About from \"./About.js\"\nimport Projects from \"./Projects.js\"\n\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Router>\n        <NAV />\n        <Routes>\n          <Route index element={<Home />} />\n          <Route path=\"/About\" element={<About />} />\n          <Route path=\"/Projects\" element={<Projects />} />\n\n        </Routes>\n      </Router>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { StrictMode } from \"react\";\nimport { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\n\nimport App from \"./App\";\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nconst root = createRoot(rootElement);\n\nroot.render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
